# Quantifying positive selection on the human X chromosome and its impact on autism
Analyzing patterns of genetic diversity in order to identify potential positively selected genes on the human X chromosome across several populations to answer: (1) if positively selected genes are enriched for ASD, and if that is true, (2) if positive selection is more common in genes that are involved in both spermatid and neuron development compared to those that are only involved in neuron development.
