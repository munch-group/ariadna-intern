# Quantifying positive selection on the human X chromosome and its impact on autism
Past studies on autism have always neglected the complicated analysis of the X chromosome due to its different inheritance pattern. In this project,we analyzed patterns of genetic diversity in order to identify potential positively selected genes on the human X chromosome across several populations to answer: (1) if positively selected genes are enriched for ASD, and if that is true, (2) if positive selection is more common in genes that are involved in both spermatid and brain development compared to those that are only involved in brain development.
